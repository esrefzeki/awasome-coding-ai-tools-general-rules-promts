# Code Modification Checklist and Rules

1. Pre-Change Analysis:
   - List ALL properties of the code to be modified:
     * Attributes and their types
     * Database constraints (foreign keys, unique constraints)
     * Indexes and their purposes
     * Default values and nullable status
     * Docstrings and comments
     * Related DTOs and response models
   - Find ALL files requiring similar changes using codebase search
   - Evaluate dependencies and potential side effects
   - Check if the change affects API responses or requests

2. Change Planning:
   - Document step-by-step changes
   - Identify risks for each step
   - Compare before/after states
   - Plan database migrations carefully
   - Consider backward compatibility
   - Plan for data migration if needed

3. Quality Control Checklist:

   - [ ] Changes reviewed for completeness
   - [ ] No unintended side effects
   - [ ] Performance verified
   - [ ] All tests passing

IMPORTANT: Never proceed without completing this checklist!

  # Personal Preferences
  - Never touch the filesystem, db models, alembic files, or migration operations before confirmation.
  - Never touch dependencies without my confirmation. And always use fixed types for dependencies.
  - Present your changes as a step-by-step plan and wait for my approval.
  - Also, teach me the logic of what you did.
  
  # Key Principles
  - Write concise, technical responses with accurate Python examples.
  - Use functional, declarative programming; avoid classes where possible.
  - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
  - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., is_active, has_permission).
  - Use lowercase with underscores for directories and files (e.g., routers/user_routes.py).
  - Favor named exports for routes and utility functions.
  - Use the Receive an Object, Return an Object (RORO) pattern.
  
  # Python/FastAPI
  - Use def for pure functions and async def for asynchronous operations.
  - Use type hints for all function signatures. Prefer Pydantic models over raw dictionaries for input validation.
  - File structure: exported router, sub-routes, utilities, static content, types (models, schemas).
  - Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditional statements.
  - For single-line statements in conditionals, omit curly braces.
  - Use concise, one-line syntax for simple conditional statements (e.g., if condition: do_something()).
  
  # Error Handling and Validation
  - Prioritize error handling and edge cases:
    - Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
    - Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
    - Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
    - Avoid unnecessary else statements; use the if-return pattern instead.
    - Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
    - Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
    - Use custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.
  
  # Dependencies
  - FastAPI
  - Pydantic v2
  - Async database libraries like asyncpg
  - Sync database libraries like psycopg2
  - SQLAlchemy 2.0 (if using ORM features)
  
  # FastAPI-Specific Guidelines
  - Use functional components (plain functions) and Pydantic models for input validation and response schemas.
  - Use declarative route definitions with clear return type annotations.
  - Use def for synchronous operations and async def for asynchronous ones.
  - Minimize @app.on_event("startup") and @app.on_event("shutdown"); prefer lifespan context managers for managing # startup and shutdown events.
  - Use middleware for logging, error monitoring, and performance optimization.
  - Optimize for performance using async functions for I/O-bound tasks, caching strategies, and lazy loading.
  - Use HTTPException for expected errors and model them as specific HTTP responses.
  - Use middleware for handling unexpected errors, logging, and error monitoring.
  - Use Pydantic's BaseModel for consistent input/output validation and response schemas.
  
  # Performance Optimization
  - Minimize blocking I/O operations; use asynchronous operations for all database calls and external API requests.
  - Implement caching for static and frequently accessed data using tools like Redis or in-memory stores.
  - Optimize data serialization and deserialization with Pydantic.
  - Use lazy loading techniques for large datasets and substantial API responses.
  
  # Key Conventions
  1. Rely on FastAPIâ€™s dependency injection system for managing state and shared resources.
  2. Prioritize API performance metrics (response time, latency, throughput).
  3. Limit blocking operations in routes:
     - Favor asynchronous and non-blocking flows.
     - Use dedicated async functions for database and external API operations.
     - Structure routes and dependencies clearly to optimize readability and maintainability.
  
  Refer to FastAPI documentation for Data Models, Path Operations, and Middleware for best practices.
